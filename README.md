## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- tkinter (usually included with Python)
- Standard library modules: `os`, `shutil`, `subprocess`, `platform`, `threading`

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/folder-copier-pro.git
   cd folder-copier-pro
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Optional: Create a desktop shortcut (Windows):**
   - Right-click on `main.py`
   - Select "Create shortcut"
   - Move shortcut to desktop
   - Rename to "Folder Copier Pro"

### Building Executable (Optional)

To create a standalone executable:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=icon.ico main.py
```

## Usage

### First Time Setup

1. **Launch the application**
2. **Access Settings** (default password: `password`)
3. **Configure your preferences:**
   - Set source and destination folders
   - Choose between local or network folder types
   - Configure network IP if using network folders
   - Set auto-close preference
   - Change default password for security

### Basic Operation

1. **Select folder type** in settings (Local or Network)
2. **Choose source folder** - the folder you want to copy
3. **Choose destination** - where you want to copy the folder
4. **Monitor network status** (if using network folders)
5. **Click "Copy Folder"** to start the operation
6. **Review results** in the success/error dialog

### Network Setup

For network folder operations:
1. Go to **Settings > Connection tab**
2. Select "Network Folder" option
3. Enter the target network IP address
4. Use the refresh button to test connectivity
5. Green indicator = connected, Red = disconnected

### Security Features

- **Session Management**: Enter password once per session
- **Logout**: Click logout to end your session
- **Password Change**: Use Security tab to update your password
- **Settings Protection**: All configuration changes require authentication

## Configuration

The application stores settings in `settings.txt` with the following format:

```
# Source folder path
/path/to/source

# Destination folder path
/path/to/destination

# Network IP address
192.168.1.100

# Password
your_secure_password

# Folder type (local/network)
local

# Auto close after copy
false
```

### Configuration Options

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Source Path | Source folder location | Empty |
| Destination Path | Destination folder location | Empty |
| Network IP | IP address for network operations | 127.0.0.1 |
| Password | Settings access password | password |
| Folder Type | local or network | local |
| Auto Close | Close app after successful copy | false |

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **GUI Framework**: tkinter with ttk for modern widgets
- **Threading**: Network operations run in background threads
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **File Operations**: Uses Python's `shutil` for reliable folder copying

### Network Testing
- **Windows**: Uses `ping -n 1 -w 3000 [IP]`
- **Unix/Linux/macOS**: Uses `ping -c 1 -W 3 [IP]`
- **Timeout**: 5-second maximum for network tests
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking network status checks

### Security Considerations
- Passwords stored in plain text (consider encryption for production use)
- Session-based authentication prevents repeated password entry
- Settings file should be kept secure

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Network status shows disconnected but network is working
- **Solution**: Check IP address in settings, try manual refresh

**Problem**: Application won't start
- **Solution**: Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed and tkinter is available

**Problem**: Copy operation fails
- **Solution**: Check folder permissions and available disk space

**Problem**: Settings not saving
- **Solution**: Ensure write permissions in application directory

### Error Messages

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Please set source and destination folders" | Paths not configured | Configure paths in settings |
| "No connection to the network" | Network unreachable | Check network settings and connectivity |
| "Destination folder already exists" | Target exists | Choose overwrite or select different destination |
| "Incorrect password" | Wrong password entered | Enter correct password or reset |
