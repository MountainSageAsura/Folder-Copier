- Standard library modules: `os`, `shutil`, `subprocess`, `platform`, `threading`, `json`, `logging`

### Installation

Install PyQt6 using pip:
```bash
pip install PyQt6
```

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/folder-copier-pro.git
   cd folder-copier-pro
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Optional: Create a desktop shortcut (Windows):**
   - Right-click on `main.py`
   - Select "Create shortcut"
   - Move shortcut to desktop
   - Rename to "Folder Copier Pro"

### Building Executable (Optional)

To create a standalone executable with PyQt6:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "FolderCopierPro" main.py
```

**Note**: PyQt6 will be automatically bundled with the executable, making it larger but self-contained.

## Usage

### First Time Setup

1. **Launch the application**
2. **Access Settings** (default password: `password`)
3. **Configure your preferences:**
   - Set source and destination folders
   - Choose between local or network folder types
   - Configure network IP if using network folders
   - Set auto-close preference
   - Change default password for security

### Basic Operation

1. **Select folder type** in settings (Local or Network)
2. **Choose source folder** - the folder you want to copy
3. **Choose destination** - where you want to copy the folder
4. **Monitor network status** (if using network folders)
5. **Click "Copy Folder"** to start the operation
6. **Review results** in the success/error dialog

### Network Setup

For network folder operations:
1. Go to **Settings > Connection tab**
2. Select "Network Folder" option
3. Enter the target network IP address
4. Use the refresh button to test connectivity
5. Green indicator = connected, Red = disconnected

### Security Features

- **Session Management**: Enter password once per session
- **Logout**: Click logout to end your session
- **Password Change**: Use Security tab to update your password
- **Settings Protection**: All configuration changes require authentication

## Configuration

The application stores settings in `settings.json` with the following format:

```json
{
    "source_path": "/path/to/source",
    "destination_path": "/path/to/destination", 
    "network_ip": "192.168.1.100",
    "password": "your_secure_password",
    "folder_type": "local",
    "auto_close": false,
    "version": "1.0",
    "last_updated": "2025-06-15T10:30:00.000000"
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Source Path | Source folder location | Empty |
| Destination Path | Destination folder location | Empty |
| Network IP | IP address for network operations | 127.0.0.1 |
| Password | Settings access password | password |
| Folder Type | local or network | local |
| Auto Close | Close app after successful copy | false |

## Technical Details

### Technical Details

### Architecture
- **GUI Framework**: PyQt6 for modern, native interface
- **Multi-threading**: Background operations for copy and network checking
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **File Operations**: Python's `shutil` with progress tracking
- **Real-time Updates**: Signal/slot system for live UI updates
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging with GUI integration
- **Error Handling**: Multi-layer error handling with user feedback

### Modern UI Features
- **Emoji Integration**: Visual recognition with contextual emojis
  - üìÅ Main window and folder operations
  - üîí Authentication and security
  - ‚öôÔ∏è Settings and configuration
  - üåê Network connectivity
  - üìä Progress and monitoring
- **Live Log Display**: Real-time operation monitoring
- **Progress Visualization**: Detailed progress bars and status text
- **Responsive Design**: Proper scaling and modern layouts

### Enhanced Copy Process
The application provides detailed monitoring during copy operations:
1. **Pre-copy Analysis**: Calculates total files and required space
2. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar (0-100%)
3. **Live Logging**: Each file copy logged with timestamp
4. **Status Updates**: Detailed current operation display
5. **Cancellation Support**: User can cancel mid-operation
6. **Error Recovery**: Automatic rollback on failure

### Copy Progress Stages
- **5%**: Analyzing source folder
- **10%**: Preparing destination
- **15%**: Removing old backup (if needed)
- **20%**: Creating backup of existing folder
- **25-95%**: File-by-file copying with live updates
- **100%**: Copy completed successfully

### Logging System
- **Daily log files** stored in `logs/` directory
- **Multiple log levels**: INFO, WARNING, ERROR
- **Automatic log rotation** by date
- **Detailed operation tracking** for troubleshooting

### Network Testing
- **Windows**: Uses `ping -n 1 -w 3000 [IP]`
- **Unix/Linux/macOS**: Uses `ping -c 1 -W 3 [IP]`
- **Timeout**: 5-second maximum for network tests
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking network status checks

### Security Considerations
- Passwords stored in plain text (consider encryption for production use)
- Session-based authentication prevents repeated password entry
- Settings file should be kept secure

## Troubleshooting

### Logging and Diagnostics
The application creates detailed logs in the `logs/` directory. Check the most recent log file for detailed error information:
- `logs/app_YYYYMMDD.log` - Daily log files with all operations
- Logs include timestamps, operation details, and error traces
- Use log files to diagnose issues and report bugs

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Network status shows disconnected but network is working
- **Solution**: Check IP address in settings, try manual refresh
- **Check logs**: Look for network timeout or ping errors

**Problem**: Application won't start
- **Solution**: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed and PyQt6 is available (`pip install PyQt6`)
- **Check logs**: Look for initialization errors in the log file
- **PyQt6 Issues**: Verify PyQt6 installation with `python -c "from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication"`

**Problem**: Copy operation fails
- **Solution**: Check folder permissions, available disk space, and source folder existence
- **Check logs**: Detailed error information will be in the log file

**Problem**: Settings not saving
- **Solution**: Ensure write permissions in application directory
- **Check logs**: Look for JSON write errors or permission issues

**Problem**: "Insufficient disk space" error
- **Solution**: Free up space on the destination drive or choose a different location
- **Details**: The app calculates source folder size and compares with available space

### Error Messages

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Please set source and destination folders" | Paths not configured | Configure paths in settings |
| "Source folder does not exist" | Invalid source path | Verify source folder exists and is accessible |
| "No connection to the network" | Network unreachable | Check network settings and connectivity |
| "Insufficient disk space" | Not enough space on destination | Free up space or choose different destination |
| "Failed to delete existing _old folder" | Permission or lock issues | Check folder permissions and close any open files |
| "Incorrect password" | Wrong password entered | Enter correct password or reset |
| "Settings file is corrupted" | Invalid JSON format | App will recreate with defaults, check logs for details |
